# Responsive Email for ShopStyle
This is a reusable responsive email grid I have created using ShopStyle brand guideliness. 

Note: this project is well commented to explain the different sections and reasoning behind my logic/problem solving, but final product would not contain these. 

This small project demonstrates my ability to:
 * follow brand guideliness
 * create a reusable template
 * maintain responsiveness across all mail clients
 * demonstrate expertise of email best practices
 
To deploy locally:
 * clone repo locally
 * navigate to directory where file has been saved
 * open index.html in browser
  
To view final product online visit: **coming soon**
